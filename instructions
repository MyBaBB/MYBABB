11.   Tailwind.config file. type:   content: ['./build/*html'],

12. in terminal type 
"npm init -y" to start server. that creates a json file for later to make easier.

13.   copy and paste this into scripts in json file.

  19. add !emmet to html file to get rid of warning in build/index.html


  type link: for intellisense
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"> double check if css/ is on there.

 20. add body style inside html
     body class='min-h-screen' and hover  its 100vh
